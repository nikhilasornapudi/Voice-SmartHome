# Voice-SmartHome

Welcome to the Voice SmartHome repository! This project demonstrates a smart home automation system controlled through voice commands. It integrates various technologies to provide an interactive and intelligent home experience.

Overview

The Voice SmartHome project allows users to control smart home devices using voice commands. It includes functionalities for managing lights, thermostats, and other smart devices through natural language processing and voice recognition.

Features

	•	Voice Control: Control smart home devices using voice commands.
	•	Device Management: Manage various smart home devices including lights, thermostats, and more.
	•	Natural Language Processing: Understand and process voice commands using advanced NLP techniques.
	•	Real-time Interaction: Provide instant feedback and responses to user commands.

Requirements

To run the Voice SmartHome system, you need the following:

	•	Google Text-to-Speech API: This project requires a Google Text-to-Speech API key for voice synthesis. 
     You can obtain an API key by setting up a project in the Google Cloud Console and enabling the Text-to-Speech API.


Project Structure

Here’s a brief overview of the project’s structure:

	•	/src: Contains the source code for the voice recognition and smart home control system.
	•	/docs: Documentation related to the project.
	•	/assets: Assets such as images, diagrams, and other resources.
	•	README.md: This file, providing an overview and instructions.
	•	requirements.txt: List of dependencies required for the project.

Getting Started

To get started with the Voice SmartHome project, follow these steps:

  1.  Clone the Repository

    `git clone https://github.com/nikhilasornapudi/Voice-SmartHome.git `

  2.	Navigate to the Project Directory

    `cd Voice-SmartHome`

  3. Install Dependencies

    `npm install`

  4.	Configure the Google Text-to-Speech API

    •	Go to the Google Cloud Console.
  	•	Create a new project or select an existing one.
  	•	Enable the Text-to-Speech API for your project.
  	•	Create credentials (API key) for accessing the API.
  	•	Save the API key in a file named .env in the root directory of the project with the following content:

    `GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here`

  5. Run the Application
    
    Start the voice recognition and smart home control system:
    `npm start`

Make sure your microphone and smart home devices are properly set up and connected.

Usage

After setting up the system, you can control your smart home devices using voice commands. For example:

	•	“Turn on the lights”: Turns on the lights in the specified room.
	•	“Set the thermostat to 72 degrees”: Adjusts the thermostat to the desired temperature.
	•	“Turn off the kitchen light”: Turns off the light in the kitchen.
